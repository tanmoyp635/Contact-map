# Contact-map
This Python code computes a contact map for any system size, excluding i, i±1 residue pairs. It uses a 4.5 Å cutoff between any heavy atoms of residue pairs. From an equilibrated PDB file, it generates a pseudo list of potential contacts, retaining only those present in at least 75% of the frames.
